he mod where you slay the wretched under the name of the Lord

Malignant is a mod focused on slaying the evil of this land (heavily inspired by Christian theology) in a Blasphemous-like style.
We also want to expand the Evil biomes of Terraria by adding content related to our theme (and to the spider biome).
We also want to include:
-A brutal execution system to terrify your unholy foes.
-Multiple demon and pagan bosses to test your God's authority
-A prayer system AND a morality system (remember, God watches)
